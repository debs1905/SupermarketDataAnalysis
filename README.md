How many times have you desired to get an editable file instead of the traditional piece of paper you can’t work with? Let’s imagine you have a magazine article or a simply PDF and want to digitize it. Sure, you can scan the document and have it on your computer, but it won’t be editable, and you can’t make the needed changes in it. That’s when OCR software technology comes in to make your life easier.

Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is a business solution for automating data extraction from printed or written text from a scanned document or image file and then converting the text into a machine-readable form to be used for data processing like editing or searching. This technology helps not just digitizing documents but also improving data accessibility and enhancing file security.
